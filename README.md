# Analystt.ai-assignment
The objective of this assignment is to develop a simple automated test script using Python and the Selenium testing framework to automate the login process of a sample web application. The assignment aims to demonstrate your ability to interact with web elements, input data, and validate login success or failure using Selenium
Requirements:

Python and Selenium: You are required to use Python as the programming language and Selenium as the testing framework for this assignment. Ensure that you have Selenium installed in your Python environment.

Web Application: Assume a hypothetical web application with a login page. You will need to automate the login process for this application.

Test Script: Develop a Python script that automates the following steps:

Launches a web browser (e.g., Chrome) using Selenium WebDriver.
Navigates to the login page of the sample web application.
Locates the username and password input fields using appropriate methods (e.g., by name, by XPath, etc.).
Enters valid login credentials (username and password) into the respective input fields.
Submit the login form (e.g., by pressing Enter or clicking a login button).
Waits for the login process to complete and verifies the success or failure of the login attempt.
Output Messages: The script should provide appropriate output messages to indicate whether the login process was successful or if it encountered any issues. For example, it should print "Login successful!" on successful login and provide error messages if any exceptions occur.

Customization: The script should be adaptable to different web applications. Make sure that placeholders like URLs, element locators (e.g., name attributes), and login credentials are replaceable with actual values specific to the web application under test.

Documentation: Include comments in your code to explain each step of the automation process. The comments should describe the purpose of the code and any important details.

Submission:

You should submit the following for this assignment:

The Python script was developed to automate the login process.
Any necessary instructions for setting up the testing environment or running the script.
A brief explanation of how you customized the script for the hypothetical web application.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness: The script successfully automates the login process.
Customization: The script can be easily customized for different web applications.
Code Quality: The code is well-structured and well-documented with comments.
Error Handling: The script handles exceptions and provides informative error messages.
Output Messages: The script provides appropriate output messages to indicate success or failure.
